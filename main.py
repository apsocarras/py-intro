# Write the following in a file called main.py:

#     A function called list_sayer() that takes a list as an argument
#         If the list isn't empty (i.e. there's one or more items in it):
#             print a string for each item saying the name of the item and its index
#             return the Boolean True
#         If the list is empty:
#             print a string saying that the list is empty
#             return the Boolean False

def list_sayer(ls:list):
  

#     A function called dict_sayer() that takes a dictionary as an argument
#         If the dictionary isn't empty (i.e. there's one or more items in it):
#             print a string for each item saying the name of each key and its value
#             return the Boolean True
#         If the dictionary is empty:
#             print a string saying that the dictionary is empty
#             return the Boolean False

#     A function called greatest() that takes as an argument a dictionary that has strings as keys and integers as values
#         find the greatest value
#         return a tuple with the greatest value and its key

#     A function called zipper() that takes two lists as arguments
#         If the lists are the same length:
#             return a dictionary that has the items of the first list as keys, and each item in the same index in the second list as the value > For instance, the lists ["vanilla", "cherry"] and ["cake", "ice_cream"] would return {"vanilla": "cake", "cherry": "ice_cream"}
#         If the lists are different lengths:
#             return a tuple with each list and its length > For instance, the lists ["vanilla", "cherry", "pistachio"] and ["cake", "ice_cream"] would return (["vanilla", "cherry", "pistachio"], 3, ["cake", "ice_cream"], 4)
